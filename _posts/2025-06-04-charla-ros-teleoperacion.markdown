description: >
  <p>From <strong>@airosespol</strong>, we proudly share the participation of <strong>Ph.D. Nabih Pico</strong>, together with <strong>Winter Delgado and León Vargas</strong>, in a high-level technical talk organized jointly with <strong>@ieee.ups.quito.ras</strong>. 🎓🤝</p>

  <p>During the session, key strategies for addressing failures in autonomous navigation systems were explored, highlighting the importance of remote monitoring and real-time human intervention.</p>
  
  <p>Extensive tests were presented using both <strong>ROS 1 and ROS 2</strong>, <strong>Gazebo (Classic & Fortress)</strong> simulators, and deployment on real robots like the <strong>TurtleBot 3</strong>.</p>

  <h3>🔍 Featured Topics:</h3>
  <ul style="text-align: left;">
      <li><strong>Latency:</strong> Technical performance comparison between ROS 1 vs ROS 2.</li>
      <li><strong>Interfaces:</strong> Real-time teleoperation via web and mobile Apps developed in <strong>Flutter</strong>.</li>
      <li><strong>Synchronization:</strong> Communication challenges between PC, TurtleBot, and control interfaces.</li>
      <li><strong>Data Transmission:</strong> Impact of message loss (especially video) on remote operation.</li>
      <li><strong>Sensors and Control:</strong> Evaluation of LiDAR, RGB camera, odometry, and control via keyboard/joystick.</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="text-center"><strong>🚀 We continue advancing in collaborative and intelligent robotics! Thanks to everyone for attending.</strong></p>
