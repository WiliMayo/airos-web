  <p>On Friday, <strong>September 26, 2025</strong>, we were present at the <strong>ESPOL Novatada</strong>, the event that brings together all the university clubs to introduce themselves to the new polytechnic students.</p>

  <p>🚀 From <strong>AIROS</strong>, we shared our passion for robotics, mechatronics, and technological innovation, showing first-semester students what it means to be part of a community that builds, learns, and experiments.</p>

  <p>🙌 We loved seeing so much interest, curiosity, and motivation in those who approached our stand, learned about our projects, and decided to take the first step to become part of this great family.</p>

  <p>💡 The Novatada was not only an opportunity to show who we are but also to inspire future members to develop their potential, live new experiences, and work as a team in an environment of creativity and constant learning.</p>

  <p class="text-center"><strong>💙 Thanks to everyone who stopped by to say hello. This is just the beginning of a path full of achievements that we will build together!</strong></p>
