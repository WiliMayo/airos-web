  <p>🎤🤖 On <strong>December 2, 2024</strong>, AIROS organized an incredible talk for ESPOL students, presented by the distinguished <strong>Ph.D. Altair Coutinho</strong>.</p>
  
  <p>In this keynote lecture, valuable insights on <strong>artificial muscles applied to robotics</strong> were explored, analyzing the evolution of actuators used in modern robotic systems.</p>

  <h3>💡 Key Topics Discussed:</h3>
  <ul style="text-align: left;">
      <li><strong>Active Polymers:</strong> Analysis of polymer-based artificial muscles and their real-world performance in robots.</li>
      <li><strong>Hyper-VAM Technology:</strong> In-depth advances in the Hyperbaric Vacuum-based Artificial Muscle.</li>
      <li><strong>Environmental Optimization:</strong> How to adapt these systems to function in diverse conditions.</li>
      <li><strong>Actuator Physics:</strong> Studies on the speed-force relationship in these new materials.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>It was a very enriching session where students were able to delve into emerging technologies that are transforming Soft Robotics.</p>
